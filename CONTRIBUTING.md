# Contributing to Chess Moves of a Knight
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Chess Moves of the Knight and its packages, which are hosted in the ACM PES University, EC Campus on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct
Given in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/acmpesuecc/chess_moves_of_knight/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## For queries
Contact shr1010@gmail.com

## Getting Started
Although chess is a very interesting two player game a chess board is also equally interesting as it opens doors to various computational problems. The moves of the knight are rather unusual and make a great programming problem.
### Prequisites:
- C compiler (gcc)
- Basic knowledge of the moves in the game chess
- Knowledge of the use of multi-dimensional arrays
### How can I contribute?
#### First contribution
There are issues labelled that would be easy to contribute to for beginners.
#### Bug reports
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Include screenshots
#### Enhancements
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots
- List some other libraries where this enhancement exists
#### Pull Requests
The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain code quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions
Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
- Follow all instructions in the template
- After you submit your pull request, verify that it works for all possibilities
- If the code is failing please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is happening or when it happens. If it concluded that the failure was a false positive, then an issue will be opened to track that problem.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
## Style guide
Use present tense for commit messages
